## üöÄ Project Overview

Problem Statement: "AI is making phising so realistic." Its breaking down our Online security. How do we fight back ?

With the rapid rise of AI-generated content, phishing emails are now more sophisticated than ever.  
Our project, **Cyber Sentinel**, aims to tackle this pressing issue by leveraging Machine Learning to classify email content as **Phishing** or **Not Phishing**, all through a seamless Chrome Extension interface.
